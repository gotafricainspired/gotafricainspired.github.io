         We are experimenting with news content and open publishing practices. 
         Join us if you value our way of doing, and want to take part to this.

          Contributing is simple:
          <ul style="text-align: left" >
            <li>If you are a blogger, journalist, or someone doing/building stuff, send us inspiring stories to feature.</li>
            <li>
              If you are a designer or developer, help us with building the site's features. 
              Get in touch to propose your idea, or send pull requests on github.com.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </p>
            
      <p style="text-align: left" >
          Once your first contribution is accepted, you become a member of the team.
