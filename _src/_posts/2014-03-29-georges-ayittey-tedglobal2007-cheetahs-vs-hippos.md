About 6 years ago, I came across the video of [this talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/george_ayittey_on_cheetahs_vs_hippos) 
by Ghanaian economist Georges Ayittey at TEDGlobal 2007 (Africa: The Next Chapter). 

I have listened to it countless of times, along with [the one by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala](https://www.ted.com/talks/ngozi_okonjo_iweala_on_aid_versus_trade), 
the finance minister of Nigeria.

These talks were influential for me, helping improve my awareness on a number of issues and 
understand the changes in action in Africa. Today, I enjoyed listening to them again.
