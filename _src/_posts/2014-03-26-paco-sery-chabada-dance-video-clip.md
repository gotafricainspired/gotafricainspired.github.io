A video clip of [Paco Sery](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/12/style/12iht-PACO.2.t.html) performing <em>and living</em> on <em>Chabada danse</em>. 

A gift by the musician from Côte d'Ivoire, most known as the drummer of the french 
jazz fusion band Sixun and for his collaboration with [Joe Zawinul](http://www.joezawinul.com/).

I also love watching [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSMDmtOx4s) of Sixun's 20th anniversary concert, at La Cigale in Paris.
If in a hurry, you might want to jump to 39:05 to see the energic part.

Music is love. Enjoy and share!
