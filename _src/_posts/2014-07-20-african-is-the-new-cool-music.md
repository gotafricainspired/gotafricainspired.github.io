If you are looking for the definition of *the New Cool* today, I propose you look at Africa and its creativity, 
with young artists, entrepreneurs, and various talents, making the news on the web and social networks every day.

Let's start with the music industry developing steadily, with producers and artists from the continent and its diaspora, 
mainly Nigeria, but also Ghana - where, as you may know, the Azonto dance and music style come from.

On the international scene, [a new category was born](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/19/the-rise-of-afrobeats) from this music movement, and it is called *Afrobeats*.

Here is a selection of videos to present these talents and their diversity. 
Obviously, there are many others to showcase, including the underrated ones.

Enjoy!
