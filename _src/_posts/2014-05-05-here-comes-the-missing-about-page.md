I almost forgot adding the About page. Now it is done! 

So what is all this about?

The main purpose of this site is to document and share the awesomeness out there in Africa and within its diaspora,
in the mindset, productions, and creations of the people.

It is somewhere between a niche site targeting our success stories and a community blog allowing 
any contributor to share inspiring articles. We mostly feature video and audio content, but editorial posts 
are planned for the near future.

If you want to contribute, get in touch via [@kamon](https://twitter.com/kamon) to suggest a story or 
[help improve the site via our issue tracker](https://github.com/gotafricainspired/gotafricainspired.github.io/issues) on github.com.
