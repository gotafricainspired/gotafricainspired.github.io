A video clip of [Paco Sery](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/12/style/12iht-PACO.2.t.html) performing and living on <em>Chabada danse</em>. 

Another gift by the drummer from Côte d'Ivoire, most known as the famous drummer of the francophone jazz fusion band Sixun and for 
his collaboration with [Joe Zawinul](http://www.zawinulmusic.com/).

Music is love. Enjoy and dance!
