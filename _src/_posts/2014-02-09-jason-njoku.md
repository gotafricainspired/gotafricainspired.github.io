Jason Njoku is a Nigerian Internet entrepreneur, and is CEO and founder of Iroko Partners, the creators of IrokoTV.com.
In this talk at TEDxEuston 2011, he gives his view on <em>Success</em>, based on his own story and the failures 
that are part of the entrepreneur's journey. 

He keeps repeating something that resonates in me: <em>The importance of embracing failure</em>. <br>
Fear not! Just get going!
And let's keep learning from the likes of Jason Njoku, inspirations for the new generation of african entrepreneurs.
