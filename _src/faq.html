<h4>What's all this about? Is it a blog?</h4>

<p>You might call it a blog, due to the format we use. But we prefer to see it as an independant publishing.</p>

<p>We are building and sharing collections of videos and articles related to 
african stories that can inspire all of us, african and non-african, in our lives, and for our work and creativity.
</p>

<h4>But I've already seen some of the stuff you publish, even years back</h4>

<p>Short answer: The old can inspire the new.</p>

<p>Long answer: We have a different approach. We do not feature stories on the unique criteria that 
the topic is current, hot or trendy. Our timing is one of calmly looking at a timeframe of years and getting a 10ft 
look at things.
We believe it is an interesting experience, and one that is needed as an addition and alternative to today's
"get me the latest news on my phone from facebook" way.
<br>
We select great stories and creations from Africa and from the web, even if they were initially published several years ago, 
as long as they are inspirational.
</p>

<h4>How do I use the site?</h4>

<p>Basically, you can read the articles, watch the videos, and listen to the audios posted, and give feedback.</p>

<p>But that's not all... We are a community powered website, and you can <a href="{{ site.url }}/contribute.html" >take part to this collective effort</a>.</p>
