<h4>What's all this about? Is it a blog?</h4>

<p>You might call it a blog, due to the format we use. But we prefer to see it as an independant publishing.</p>

<p>We are building and sharing a collection, actually several collections of media and articles related to african success stories 
or simply stories that can inspire all of us, african and non-african, in our lives, our work, our dreams.
</p>

<p>We value authenticity, openness and sharing, and as you read through the posts, you should see these values 
reflected. 
</p>

<h4>But I've already seen some of the stuff you publish, even years back</h4>

<p>Short answer: The old can inspire the new.</p>

<p>Long answer: We are different from a classical news site, since we do not feature stories on the unique criteria that 
the topic is current, hot or trendy. Our timing is one of calmly looking at a timeframe of years and getting a 10ft look at things.
We believe it is an interesting experience, and one that is needed as a complement and alternative to today's
"get me the latest news on my phone from facebook" way.
<br>
We select great stories and creations from Africa and from the web, even if they were initially published several years ago, 
as long as they are inspirational and can contribute to a better world.
</p>

<h4>How do I use your site?</h4>

<p>Basically, you can read the articles, see the videos, and listen to the audios posted, give feedback and share your own views by commenting.</p>
<p>But that's not all... You can also contribute.</p>

<h4>I really like this. How can I contribute?</h4>

<p>You can also take part to this collective publishing project.</p>
